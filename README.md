This is a user script that can be run in tamper monkey or userscripts on iOS that will clean up the chapter summaries on coppermind.net making it pleasant to listen to. It gets rid of all of the characters, navigation, images, and chapter blurbs. Once those are gone you can start reading the webpage. It is a great way to review the contents of previous books when a new one comes out.

To install go to the user script, choose raw and then the extension should be able to find it and install it.
