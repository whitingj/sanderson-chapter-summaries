This is a user script that can be run in tamper monkey or userscripts on iOS that will clean up the chapter summaries on coppermind.net making it pleasant to listen to. It gets rid of all of the characters, navigation, images, and chapter blurbs. Once those are gone you can start reading the webpage. It is a great way to review the contents of previous books when a new one comes out.

## How to use:
* Install the user script by going to the raw version of the user.js file or click on the link below.
  * <https://github.com/whitingj/sanderson-chapter-summaries/raw/refs/heads/main/sanderson-coppermind-chapter-clean-chapter-summaries.user.js>

* Go to a chapter summary page on coppermind.net.
  * <https://coppermind.net/wiki/Summary:The_Way_of_Kings>

* Start the reading the webpage.
  * On iOS in Safari, click the web page options icon immediately to the left of the website address, and then press the "Listen to Page" button.

*Note: I've only tested this on Safari on iOS and Chrome.*
